//! One sortie and return: the joint receipt's machine.
//!
//! Every tick moves the played body toward its goal and lets each companion
//! move by their agreed part. There is no call that moves a companion
//! directly: the drivers read agreements, positions, and the ground, never
//! an order, which is the puppeteering canary held at the API as usual.
//!
//! The world itself is the hazard. `near::step`'s own law says a drop past
//! `COMFORT_DROP` is taken only when nothing else remains; this crate rules
//! that such a fall is a wound, uniformly, for anyone. What downs a body is
//! narrower: only the *played* body downs, because downing is a control
//! fact — it is what the pact watches for — while a wound is a body fact
//! and lands on whoever fell. Recorded as a finding; S4 may widen it.
//!
//! An injury is a body-revision fact: the wound bumps the subject's
//! [`BodyRevisionId`] in the shared facets, and the wound record names the
//! revision it created. What a revision means stays the wing phenotype
//! contract's business; Paredros only points at it.
