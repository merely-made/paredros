//! Persistent Paredros world, embodied subjects, and recorded transitions.
//!
//! Mesocosm currently supplies verb-neutral generated topology and exact
//! material ground. This crate gives that structure Paredros meanings:
//! settlements, ruins, encounters, dungeons, inherited replacements, and
//! edits made by particular subjects. Saves carry only genesis facts and
//! ordered intents; restore regrows the base world before replaying them.
//!
//! A [`SlotId`] survives changes in what occupies it. This is the important
//! distinction for imported history: a fact replaces procedural content at
//! an existing structural address rather than adding a parallel world.
//! [`Movement`] records where a subject is and the accepted inputs that put it
//! there. [`Navigation`] is a disposable query over the same exact ground.
//! [`Bodies`] and [`Items`] own durable physical condition independently;
//! [`GameState`] composes those systems through one subject-addressed intent
//! grammar and regrows them from accepted inputs on restore.
//! [`Population`] records where named lives came from, [`Projects`] owns
//! durable goals, and [`Simulation`] advances every living subject without a
//! player, camera, or observer entering the scheduling contract.
