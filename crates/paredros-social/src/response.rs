//! Answers, and the premises behind them.
//!
//! This is the legibility surface the charter calls day-one work. Every answer
//! this crate can give carries an ordered list of [`Premise`], and a premise is
//! machine-readable rather than a rendered sentence: it names the deed ids, the
//! standing, the confidence read, and the thresholds that actually produced the
//! answer. A test can assert on them, and
//! [`crate::Society::say`] turns each into a line for the player.
//!
//! Refusal is a [`Verdict`], not an error. Nothing in this module can fail.
