//! The S1 refusal scene, as data.
//!
//! Three companions, one offer, three answers. The scene lives in the library
//! rather than in a test so the test and the printed run are provably the same
//! run, the way S0's fixed trace does it.
//!
//! Aud, Bram, Odris and Sela are fixture names for this scene. They are not
//! lore and nothing else in the repository refers to them.
//!
//! The differences are only in history, nerve, and craft:
//!
//! - **Bram** was stood by, twice, and is the better scout. Accepts.
//! - **Odris** was shared with once and then left. Is the *best* scout of the
//!   three, and refuses anyway: the model does not confuse capability with
//!   willingness.
//! - **Sela** was shared with twice and stood by once, likes Aud most of the
//!   three, and is the most careful. The ask is fine and the danger is not, so
//!   she counteroffers.
