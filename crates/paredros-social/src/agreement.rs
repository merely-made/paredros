//! Standing agreements, with the whole lifecycle present.
//!
//! The charter's shape: routine work inside a trusted role should be as easy as
//! assigning it, with the social truth that the role was agreed earlier. So an
//! agreement carries the terms, the work it covers, and its own history, and
//! every transition is also a deed in the log.
//!
//! It is still not a command. A holder may decline under a standing agreement
//! when its premises have changed, which is [`crate::response::RulingKind`]'s
//! `Declined`, and the charter names the cases: danger past what was agreed,
//! capability lost, trust collapsed.
