//! S1, the willingness owner: why a companion says yes, no, or not like that.
//!
//! The execution plan's §2 makes social willingness and combat execution
//! separate owners that never read each other, meeting only at the sortie. This
//! is the social half. It holds deeds, standing, confidence, refusal, standing
//! agreements, and the explanation surface, and it holds no bodies, no world,
//! and no fight.
//!
//! The minimal forms are all present, which was the point of the gate:
//!
//! - [`DeedLog`], append-only, who did what to whom and when;
//! - [`Standing`], folded out of the log rather than authored, carrying the
//!   ids of the deeds that produced it;
//! - [`Confidence`], a companion's own read of whether work is within their
//!   declared craft;
//! - [`Verdict::Refuse`], an outcome and never an error;
//! - [`Premise`], attached to every answer, naming the deeds, the standing,
//!   the confidence, the thresholds, and the terms that produced it;
//! - [`Agreement`], with formation, exercise, renegotiation, and ending, each
//!   transition recorded as a deed.
//!
//! **Nothing here commands anyone.** There is no call that makes a companion
//! act. Offers are put; answers come back; a standing agreement makes routine
//! work routine without making it compulsory, and a holder whose premises have
//! changed declines under one. That is the puppeteering canary held at the API
//! rather than in a comment.
