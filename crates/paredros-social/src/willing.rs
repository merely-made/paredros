//! The willingness rule.
//!
//! Deliberately small. A player has to be able to hold it in their head and
//! predict an answer from the relationship surface before committing, which the
//! charter ruled on 2026-07-31, and a rule with a dozen coefficients cannot be
//! held that way. Three gates, in this order:
//!
//! 1. **Can I do it?** Confidence, from their own declared craft. Short here
//!    and they refuse, and the refusal is about the work, not the asker.
//! 2. **Would I risk that for you?** Trust against what the danger asks.
//!    Short here and they refuse, and the refusal is about the asker.
//! 3. **Is it more than I would bear?** Danger against what affection and
//!    nerve will carry. Short here and they counteroffer rather than refuse,
//!    because the ask is fine and the terms are not.
//!
//! Every gate reached appends its premise, and gates past the deciding one are
//! not evaluated and so are not claimed.
