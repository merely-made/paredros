//! Standing: one person's read of another, as two small integers.
//!
//! Standing is never authored. It is folded out of the deed log, and it carries
//! the ids of the deeds that produced it, so the explanation surface can point
//! at the evidence instead of asserting a number. Change the log and the
//! standing changes with it; there is no second copy to drift.
