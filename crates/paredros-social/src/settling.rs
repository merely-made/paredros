//! The S2 settling scene, as data: the negotiated home.
//!
//! The same four people as [`crate::scene`], the same history, one step on:
//! Aud offers housing and daily work. The asks differ by person because the
//! work does, and the answers differ only through history, nerve, and craft:
//!
//! - **Bram** is offered the gatehouse and the bounds to walk. Accepts.
//! - **Odris** is offered the still-room and the night watch, the one craft
//!   he alone holds, at a grade he exactly meets. Refuses at the trust gate,
//!   citing the abandonment: capability is provably not the reason.
//! - **Sela** is offered the still-room and the sickroom's work at a danger
//!   past what she would carry. Counteroffers; Aud returns with her terms and
//!   the ward kept inside them, and that arrangement forms.
//!
//! Two move in, one does not, and every home traces to the bargain under it.
