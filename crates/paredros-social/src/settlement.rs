//! The settlement, in S2's minimal form: dwellings, and the tenancies that
//! agreements create.
//!
//! **Residence is derived, never bookkept.** A tenancy records only which
//! dwelling, which tenant, which agreement put them there, and when. Where
//! someone lives *now* is folded from that record and the agreement's own
//! state: a tenancy is current exactly while its agreement stands. Ending the
//! agreement *is* moving out. There is no second copy of "who lives where" to
//! fall out of step with the arrangement that answers for it, the same shape
//! [`crate::Society`] gives standing.
//!
//! The daily round derives the same way: home from the current tenancy, work
//! from the agreement under it. An accepted agreement is therefore the one
//! thing that changes where someone lives and what they do daily, which is
//! S2's done-condition made structural.
//!
//! This is the settlement tested as **peer agency**, not as production. What
//! a dwelling yields, what the work produces, and who may make offers on the
//! settlement's behalf are S5's questions and are deliberately absent.
