//! The headed D1 receipt: raymarch depth composed with Renderling.
//!
//! The renderling tenant draws the body and three cyan witness pillars with
//! its depth stored; the shared brick traversal then draws the room's rock
//! into the same colour target against that depth. Occlusion must hold in
//! both directions: the pillar before the wall covers rock, the floor covers
//! the buried pillar base, and the pillar beyond the wall never appears.
//! The run replays the fixed S0 trace, judges the final frame, and writes
//! the capture and JSON receipt.
