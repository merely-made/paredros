//! The identity prerequisites of the execution plan's §1, in minimal form.
//!
//! Four facts kept four, so that tag-in, succession, chassis replacement, and
//! descent stay four different operations rather than one muddle:
//!
//! - [`SubjectId`], the continuing person, across bodies and across control;
//! - [`BodyRevisionId`], which body at which revision;
//! - [`Facets`], character and faction facets kept separate, because a role is
//!   held and not been;
//! - [`Control`], who the player is currently being, as recorded state.
//!
//! This crate exists rather than a module because of the plan's two-owners
//! rule. Social willingness and combat execution are separate owners that never
//! read each other, and both need to name a person. A foundation crate that
//! knows nothing about either is the wall; putting `SubjectId` in one owner
//! would force the other to depend on it.
//!
//! [`BodyRevisionId`] is opaque here on purpose. The wing phenotype contract
//! owns what a body revision means; Paredros only needs to point at one.
