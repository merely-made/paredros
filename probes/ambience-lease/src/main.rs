//! P3 of mere's spatial compute plan: the wing projection.
//!
//! The second consumer of a resident spatial buffer, and the one that
//! decides whether the lease is domain-neutral. Ambience motes live in
//! a padded-3D position buffer that explicit-regime kernels advance;
//! renderling draws them as instanced geometry under a real 3D camera,
//! reading this frame's positions with no readback between the compute
//! that wrote them and the draw that consumed them.
//!
//! What P2 could not test, this does: z is meaningful (the camera looks
//! down at an angle, so depth is visible truth rather than a reserved
//! lane), and the consumer has a *different memory model*. renderling
//! addresses geometry through a craballoc slab rather than through
//! buffers a caller binds, so the lease is read by an adapter kernel
//! that writes into renderling's own storage. That mismatch, and its
//! cost, is the finding this gate exists to produce.
